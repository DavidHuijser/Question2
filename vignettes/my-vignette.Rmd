# Introduction

This is very short example of a vignette.  You can use Rmarkdown to basically design this. 
The package contains one function called `myfunctions`, which takes two arguments. 
Good news to test this you don't even have to load the data. You can use include data `mydata`.

So the easiest way to test this package is using the following command
```{r, eval=F}
studentnumber <- 100
results <- myfunctions(mydata, studentnumber)
```
